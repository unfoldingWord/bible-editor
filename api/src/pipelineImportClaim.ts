// Single-applier claim policy for AI-pipeline imports.
//
// Two pollers race to import a job the instant the bot flips it to 'done': the
// */5 cron (pollAllNonTerminal) and a translator's open tab hitting
// GET /api/pipelines/:jobId. Both gate the import on no_output_yet, read from a
// SELECT that predates the ~minute-long apply, and output_json (which clears
// that flag) is written only after the poll completes — so both can enter
// importJobOutput. Each apply's chapter-scoped deleteUnkeptTns then sweeps the
// OTHER apply's freshly-inserted AI rows, so their delete/insert phases
// interleave and corrupt the chapter (ISA 48 en_tn, 2026-06-30: vv.1–12 wiped,
// 13–22 doubled). importJobOutput claims the job by atomically stamping
// pipeline_jobs.import_claimed_at; the poller that loses the CAS no-ops.
//
// Leaf module (no imports) so the concurrency rule is unit-testable under
// `node --experimental-strip-types` — same pattern as shrinkGuard.ts.

// A claim left dangling by a hard Worker death (no JS throw to release it)
// becomes reclaimable by a later poll once older than this. Must comfortably
// exceed the longest real apply (a single-chapter notes apply runs ~1 min) so a
// still-running apply is never reclaimed out from under itself.

// Pure mirror of the atomic claim predicate in importJobOutput's
// `UPDATE ... WHERE` clause: a poller may take the import slot when it is
// unclaimed, or when the existing claim is older than the stale window (crash
// recovery). The production path enforces this in one CAS UPDATE rather than
// read-then-write, so two racing pollers can't both pass — this function
// documents and tests the rule, it is not the enforcement point.
