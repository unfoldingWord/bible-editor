# AI Pipeline Integration — Handoff

You are picking this up mid-flight. Read this end-to-end, then [`docs/ai-pipeline-integration.md`](./ai-pipeline-integration.md) (the contract between bible-editor and bp-assistant), before doing anything else. Both are short.

## Status (last update: 2026-05-14, after autonomous Phase 3 pass)

**Phase 1 shipped and verified live.** A successful tqs run for `ZEC 3` was triggered from the editor against bp-assistant on `uw-bt-bot.fly.dev`. The pipeline completed; the editor's polling surfaced state transitions correctly; the output landed on Door43 via the bot's existing `repo-insert` flow.

**Phase 2a shipped (parser + staging).** On the first `state="done"` poll the Worker fetches each `output[].rawUrl`, parses USFM/TSV, and stages rows into `pending_imports`. Idempotent on re-poll (existence guard on `job_id`; `pipeline_jobs.output_json` is only stamped after a successful import + apply, so a failure auto-retries on the next poll). Validated against `docs/samples/` fixtures: ZEC 3 yields 10 ULT verses, 49 TN rows, 9 TQ rows.

**Phase 2b shipped then mostly removed.** 2b built a placeholder review dialog and per-section "Review proposals" buttons. The model was then revised — AI output is now better than what it replaces, so the default action is **overwrite**, not review. Phase 2c (below) replaced 2b's UI with a lock + auto-apply model. The staging table (`pending_imports`), parsers, endpoint, and 2a importer are preserved; only the user-facing review dialog and the per-section buttons were deleted.

**Phase 2c shipped (lock + auto-apply + TN keep marks).**

- **Server-enforced chapter lock.** [`api/src/chapterLock.ts`](../api/src/chapterLock.ts) returns the first non-terminal `pipeline_jobs` row covering a `(book, chapter)`. [`api/src/rows.ts`](../api/src/rows.ts) checks the lock on POST/PATCH/DELETE and rejects with `409 {error: "chapter_locked", jobId, pipelineType, startedAt}`. PATCH on `tn` is exempt — the first PATCH on an untouched TN doubles as the "keep" action by setting `updated_by`. [`api/src/verses.ts`](../api/src/verses.ts) checks the lock on PATCH.
- **Keep endpoint.** `POST /api/rows/tn/:id/keep` — lock-exempt; bumps version, sets `updated_by`, appends an `edit_log` row with `action='keep'`. Called by the TN card's Keep checkbox.
- **Auto-apply.** [`api/src/pipelineImport.ts`](../api/src/pipelineImport.ts) now does both staging and apply in a single `importJobOutput`. Stage is idempotent on `pending_imports` existence; apply is idempotent per-row via `pending_imports.accepted_at`. TN-delete phase only targets `updated_by IS NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL` rows — re-runs are no-ops. Every apply write attributes `updated_by` to the pipeline-starting user and appends an `edit_log` row with `source='ai_pipeline'`.
- **Edit-log provenance.** Migration [`0010_edit_log_source.sql`](../api/migrations/0010_edit_log_source.sql) adds a nullable `source` column to `edit_log`. Human edits leave it NULL; the apply path sets `'ai_pipeline'`.
- **Frontend lock awareness.** [`Shell.tsx`](../web/src/components/Shell.tsx) derives `chapterLock` from `pipelineStore` (any non-terminal job covering the active chapter), threads it to columns, mounts an Alert banner above the pipeline-menu strip, and surfaces an outbox-result toast when a write is rejected as `chapter_locked`. [`ScriptureColumn.tsx`](../web/src/components/ScriptureColumn.tsx) + [`DocColumn.tsx`](../web/src/components/DocColumn.tsx) + [`BookView.tsx`](../web/src/components/BookView.tsx) OR `locked` into their existing `readOnly` derivation (which already handled UHB/UGNT). [`ResourceColumn.tsx`](../web/src/components/ResourceColumn.tsx) hides "new" buttons when locked. [`QuestionsTable.tsx`](../web/src/components/QuestionsTable.tsx) renders inputs read-only. [`WordsTable.tsx`](../web/src/components/WordsTable.tsx) disables interaction (pointer-events). [`NoteCard.tsx`](../web/src/components/NoteCard.tsx) is the most involved — when locked + `updated_by IS NULL`, the card is read-only with a Keep checkbox at the top of its header; when locked + `updated_by IS NOT NULL`, a Kept chip shows and the card stays editable.
- **Outbox 409 handling.** [`outbox.ts`](../web/src/sync/outbox.ts) gained a `locked` result kind. Ops that hit `chapter_locked` are dropped (not retried) — retrying would race with the auto-apply step. Shell subscribes to result events and toasts a "Edit dropped" message.

**Phase 2d shipped — merged to main as PR #14.**

Four items landed together:

- **Asymmetric ULT/UST alignment.** Migration [`0011_pipeline_followup.sql`](../api/migrations/0011_pipeline_followup.sql) adds `follow_up_options` + `follow_up_job_id` columns to `pipeline_jobs`. The PipelineMenu generate dialog now has four independent checkboxes — picking e.g. ULT-aligned + UST-not-aligned splits into two upstream calls (parent runs ULT alone with alignment; on the parent's `done` transition the status-poll handler fires a follow-up with `contentTypes: ["ust"], textOnly: true`). The child uses a `${parentSessionKey}/followup` sessionKey so upstream's `(sessionKey, pipelineType, scope)` dedup doesn't collide. Claim + child INSERT run in one D1 batch — a crash between them can't orphan the upstream-running follow-up, and upstream idempotency makes retries safe.
- **AI provenance chip.** Chapter handler now computes `latest_source` per TN/TQ row via a correlated subquery against `edit_log` (cheap because of the existing `(kind, row_key)` index). NoteCard renders a small "AI" chip with a sparkle next to the row id; QuestionsTable shows the sparkle inline by the Ref input. Any subsequent human edit or keep action writes a fresh `edit_log` entry with `source=NULL` so the chip disappears on the next chapter read.
- **Per-stage progress.** PipelineStatusBar's expanded panel now renders a horizontal stepper per job, indexed off `current.skill`. `generate` is Draft → Align → Push (matching `initial-pipeline` → `align-all-parallel` → `door43-push`); `notes` and `tqs` have shorter ladders. Completed stages fill green, the running stage fills blue, future stages outline. Unrecognized skills fall back to the textual line so we don't lie about progress.
- **Worker-side cron polling.** [`api/wrangler.toml`](../api/wrangler.toml) now has a second cron at `*/5 * * * *`. [`api/src/pipelines.ts`](../api/src/pipelines.ts) exports `pollAllNonTerminal(env)` and a shared `pollPipelineJob` helper (the GET handler now delegates to the same code path so the two never drift). On each tick we SELECT non-terminal jobs and poll them in parallel via `Promise.allSettled`; per-job errors are isolated. Tab-closed `done` transitions now auto-apply within 5 minutes — translators see the chapter already updated on next sign-in.

**Phase 2d verification status — partial.** Type-check passes on both api and web; migration 0011 applies locally; parser smoke test still passes. **Not yet verified end-to-end against a live bp-assistant run** (each costs 30–100 min of bot time and a translator's attention). The first real generate with asymmetric alignment, and the first cron-driven `done` transition for a closed-tab job, are the two highest-risk untouched paths. Next session should treat these as "compiled and reasoned about, not battle-tested" and avoid changes that would obscure failure modes. See [`docs/hey-human-test-this.md`](./hey-human-test-this.md) for the live-verification checklist the translator is working through.

**Phase 3 shipped (autonomous pass).** Five autonomous-safe follow-ups landed together. None is yet live-verified against bp-assistant; treat the same way as 2d (type-check + reasoning, not battle-tested).

- **Cron auto-fail sentinel.** [`pollAllNonTerminal`](../api/src/pipelines.ts) now does a sentinel UPDATE before the SELECT, flipping any non-terminal row with `updated_at < now - 86400 * 2` to `state='failed'`, `error_kind='interrupted'`. Two-day cutoff means a wedged upstream stops eating cron budget without us pre-empting healthy long runs (a 4h generate is well inside the window).
- **`already_running` UX (Phase 3.4).** [`pipelineStore`](../web/src/sync/pipelineStore.ts) now exposes `onFocusRequest`. On `start()` returning `status: "already_running"` the store emits a focus event; [`PipelineStatusBar`](../web/src/components/PipelineStatusBar.tsx) listens via a ref to the chip and opens its popover anchored there. A useEffect handles the race where the chip hasn't mounted yet (first-ever start). [`PipelineMenu`](../web/src/components/PipelineMenu.tsx) drops the "Already running:" toast since the panel auto-opens.
- **Follow-up parent-child link (Phase 3.5).** GET `/api/pipelines` now selects `follow_up_job_id`. PipelineStatusBar computes a child→parent map in a useMemo and renders "Step 1 of 2 · follow-up …xyz" / "Step 2 of 2 · after …xyz" under the relevant rows. Short jobId suffix is enough to disambiguate without bloating the panel.
- **Concurrency UX for shared chapters (Phase 3.1, minimum viable).** When upstream returns 409 conflict, the Worker now looks up the existing job in D1 (joined to `users` for the username) and merges it into the response body as `existing`. PipelineMenu renders a dialog showing pipelineType, scope, state + current_skill, who started it, how long ago. No new endpoint, no live polling — Phase 3.1 v2 can add a public-peek endpoint if translators want refresh-while-watching. Falls back to the bare 409 toast when the conflicting job was started outside the editor (e.g. Zulip) and isn't in our D1.
- **Generate chapter macro (Phase 3.3).** Migration [`0012_pipeline_followup_chain.sql`](../api/migrations/0012_pipeline_followup_chain.sql) adds `follow_up_chain TEXT` (JSON array of `{pipelineType, options?}`). New "Generate everything" menu item fires a single start with `followUpChain: [{pipelineType: 'notes'}, {pipelineType: 'tqs'}]`; `pollPipelineJob` on each done-transition calls `fireFollowUpFromChain` which pops the head, fires upstream as the next pipelineType, and stores the rest on the child row. Same atomicity story as the 0011 same-type follow-up: claim + INSERT in one D1 batch, idempotent via the parent's `follow_up_job_id IS NULL` guard. `followUpOptions` and `followUpChain` are mutually exclusive at the start-request level (Zod refine). Child sessionKeys use a `/chain{depth}` suffix so upstream's `(sessionKey, pipelineType, scope)` dedup doesn't collide across links.

**Phase 3 verification status — partial.** `npm run typecheck` passes; `npm run build` produces a clean dist; migration 0012 applies locally; parser smoke test still passes. **Highest-risk untouched paths**: (a) the cron auto-fail sentinel fires correctly on real stuck rows, (b) the chapter macro chains correctly across a real done-transition for each step, (c) the conflict dialog renders correctly when triggered by a real cross-user 409. None of these need a 1-hour pipeline run to verify — a wrangler tail with two simulated sessions would cover (c); (a) needs a manually-inserted stuck row; (b) genuinely needs a live macro run. See [`docs/hey-human-test-this.md`](./hey-human-test-this.md) "Phase 3 — PR #18" for the explicit checklist.

Still to do:
- Cancellation (Phase 3.2). Contract §11 says it's not in v1; needs a bp-assistant change too. **Not autonomous-safe** — coordinated work with the partner repo.
- Phase 3.1 v2 — live polling of other-user jobs. Today the conflict dialog is a snapshot. A "watch this run" affordance would need a public-peek endpoint (current GET /:jobId 403s on cross-user reads).
- Phase 3.5 v2 — surface the chain depth on macro children. Today the panel says "Step 2 of 2" even when a child has its own chain remainder (so it's really step 2 of N). Refine when N gets above 2.

## One-paragraph mental model

`bible-editor` runs as a Cloudflare Worker + D1 + React/Vite SPA. Translators edit translation notes / questions / word links / aligned ULT-UST verses; edits land in D1 first and DCS gets a nightly snapshot. There is an external "AI pipeline" service ([github.com/unfoldingWord/bp-assistant](https://github.com/unfoldingWord/bp-assistant), deployed at `uw-bt-bot.fly.dev`) that runs Claude-Code-driven skills to generate chapter-scale ULT/UST/notes/questions. Runs take ~30–100 minutes. The editor can now trigger those pipelines and watch their state. The pipeline writes results to Door43 (`unfoldingWord/en_{ult,ust,tn,tq}` repos). **The editor does not yet read those results back** — that's Phase 2.

## What exists today

### Backend

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`api/migrations/0008_pipeline_jobs.sql`](../api/migrations/0008_pipeline_jobs.sql) | `pipeline_jobs` table. Stores per-job state, output blob (verbatim JSON), error info, timestamps. Indexed on `(user_id, state, updated_at)` and `(book, start_chapter, pipeline_type, state)`. |
| [`api/migrations/0009_pending_imports.sql`](../api/migrations/0009_pending_imports.sql) | `pending_imports` staging table. Generic JSON-blob shape: `kind ∈ {tn, tq, verse}`, `payload_json` carries a row body matching the live POST shape. The auto-apply step now stamps `accepted_at` on each row after the corresponding live mutation lands; `rejected_at` is unused under the current overwrite model. |
| [`api/migrations/0010_edit_log_source.sql`](../api/migrations/0010_edit_log_source.sql) | Adds nullable `source TEXT` to `edit_log`. NULL for human edits, `'ai_pipeline'` for rows the auto-apply step wrote. Drives the AI chip on NoteCard / QuestionsTable. |
| [`api/migrations/0011_pipeline_followup.sql`](../api/migrations/0011_pipeline_followup.sql) | Adds `follow_up_options` + `follow_up_job_id` to `pipeline_jobs`. Stashes a second pipeline call's options on the parent row; on the parent's `done` transition the poll handler fires the follow-up upstream and clears the marker. Backs the asymmetric-alignment feature. |
| [`api/migrations/0012_pipeline_followup_chain.sql`](../api/migrations/0012_pipeline_followup_chain.sql) | Adds `follow_up_chain` (JSON-encoded `[{pipelineType, options?}]`). Cross-type follow-up chain — first element fires on the parent's done-transition; the rest is stored on the child and fires in turn. Backs the chapter macro. Mutually exclusive with `follow_up_options` at the start-request level. |
| [`api/src/chapterLock.ts`](../api/src/chapterLock.ts) | `activePipelineForChapter(env, book, chapter)` returns the first non-terminal `pipeline_jobs` row covering this scope (locks are global — any user's pipeline locks the chapter for everyone). `lockedResponseBody(lock)` returns the canonical 409 body. |
| [`api/src/pipelines.ts`](../api/src/pipelines.ts) | Three handlers: `POST /api/pipelines/start`, `GET /api/pipelines/:jobId`, `GET /api/pipelines?state=...`. Auth-gated via JWT. Pulls DCS username from JWT and bearer-swaps to `BT_API_TOKEN` upstream. The GET handler and the cron poller both call `pollPipelineJob` (fetch → import on first done → update DB → fire follow-up if queued). `pollAllNonTerminal(env)` is exported for the scheduled handler; it sentinel-UPDATEs stuck non-terminal rows (no progress for 48h → state='failed') before SELECTing the rest. POST accepts `followUpOptions` (same-type asymmetric alignment) and `followUpChain` (cross-type macro chain) — mutually exclusive. On upstream 409 conflict the response is enriched with the existing job's metadata so the menu can render a dialog instead of a bare toast. `fireFollowUp` handles the same-type case (Phase 2d); `fireFollowUpFromChain` handles the cross-type case (Phase 3.3). |
| [`api/src/chapters.ts`](../api/src/chapters.ts) | Chapter handler now computes `latest_source` per TN/TQ row from a correlated subquery against `edit_log` (cheap thanks to the existing `(kind, row_key)` index). Drives the AI chip on the frontend. |
| [`api/src/rows.ts`](../api/src/rows.ts) | Existing POST/PATCH/DELETE for tn/tq/twl rows. Now lock-checked: POST always, PATCH on non-tn kinds, DELETE always. New endpoint `POST /api/rows/tn/:id/keep` is lock-exempt and sets `updated_by` so the auto-apply step preserves the row. `newRowId()` is exported for the apply path. |
| [`api/src/verses.ts`](../api/src/verses.ts) | PATCH now lock-checks before mutating. UHB/UGNT remain blocked via the existing `source_text_is_read_only` 403. |
| [`api/src/importParsers.ts`](../api/src/importParsers.ts) | Pure parsing helpers for USFM (whole-book → verses in a chapter range, with `content_json` + `plain_text`) and TSV (Reference → `[chapter, verse]`). `scripts/import-book.mjs` still has its own copy of the same logic for the one-shot initial-book seeding case (deliberately not refactored — script is stable and standalone). |
| [`api/src/pipelineImport.ts`](../api/src/pipelineImport.ts) | `importJobOutput` now does both phases. **Stage**: fetch each `output[].rawUrl`, parse, INSERT into `pending_imports` (idempotent on existing rows). **Apply**: for every unresolved `pending_imports` row, mutate the live table and stamp `accepted_at`. Per-phase: TN delete (only `updated_by IS NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL`) → TN insert (fresh ids via `newRowId`) → TQ upsert by id → verse update by composite key. Every audit row gets `source='ai_pipeline'`. `updated_by` is the pipeline-starting user. Per-row idempotency means a mid-apply crash retries safely on the next poll. |
| [`api/src/importParsers.test.mjs`](../api/src/importParsers.test.mjs) | Smoke test against `docs/samples/`. Runs with `node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings src/importParsers.test.mjs`. |
| [`api/src/pendingImports.ts`](../api/src/pendingImports.ts) | `GET /api/pending-imports?book=&chapter=`. Kept after the 2b rollback because it's useful for ad-hoc audit queries from a dev console / wrangler tail. No UI consumes it today. |
| [`api/src/index.ts`](../api/src/index.ts) | Routes registered at `/api/pipelines` and `/api/pending-imports`. `PIPELINE_API_BASE` env var on the `Env` interface. `scheduled()` branches on `controller.cron` — `"0 6 * * *"` fires the export Workflow; `"*/5 * * * *"` runs `pollAllNonTerminal`. |
| [`api/wrangler.toml`](../api/wrangler.toml) | `PIPELINE_API_BASE = "https://uw-bt-bot.fly.dev"` default. Two crons: nightly export at 06:00 UTC + pipeline-poll every 5 minutes. |

### Frontend

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`web/src/sync/api.ts`](../web/src/sync/api.ts) | Types for `PipelineStartRequest` (now with optional `followUpOptions` for asymmetric alignment AND `followUpChain` for the macro) / `PipelineRequestOptions` / `PipelineChainStep` / `StatusResponse` / `JobRow` (carries `follow_up_job_id`) / `PendingImport` mirror the partner contract. `PipelineConflictBody` types the enriched 409 from `/start`. `TnRow` / `TqRow` carry an optional `latest_source` for the AI chip. Client methods: `pipelineStart`, `pipelineStatus`, `pipelineList`, `getPendingImports`, `keepNote`. Exports `isChapterLockedBody`. |
| [`web/src/sync/pipelineStore.ts`](../web/src/sync/pipelineStore.ts) | In-memory store with the same `subscribe(fn) => unsubscribe` shape as [`outbox.ts`](../web/src/sync/outbox.ts). Hydrates on first subscribe via `GET /api/pipelines`. Polls each non-terminal job every 2 minutes while the tab is visible (pauses on `document.hidden`, resumes on `visibilitychange`). Emits completion events via `onComplete(fn)`. New `onFocusRequest(fn)` listener fires when `start()` comes back `already_running` (or any caller of `requestFocus(jobId)`); PipelineStatusBar uses this to auto-open its panel. Persists a per-browser `sessionKey` in localStorage as `bible-editor/{userId}/{uuid}`. Includes a `findActive(type, book, chapter)` helper for the trigger UI. |
| [`web/src/sync/outbox.ts`](../web/src/sync/outbox.ts) | Drain dispatcher now recognizes a `locked` result kind for 409 chapter_locked. Locked ops are dropped (not retried, not surfaced as conflicts) — the auto-apply step will overwrite anyway. `onOutboxResult` fires so Shell can toast. |
| [`web/src/components/PipelineMenu.tsx`](../web/src/components/PipelineMenu.tsx) | Button + dropdown + confirmation dialog in the chapter view, just below `TopBar`. Four options now: `generate`, `notes`, `tqs`, `generate_macro` (the last one chains all three). The macro shares `type='generate'` with the single generate, so a running generate disables both; a distinct `key` field disambiguates them in React. For `generate` (non-macro), four **independent** sub-checkboxes (ULT / UST / ULT-align / UST-align). `buildGenerateWire` translates the four-bool state into one upstream call when symmetric, or one `options` + one `followUpOptions` when asymmetric — the server handles the second-call queuing. The macro fires `pipelineType: 'generate'` with `followUpChain: [{pipelineType: 'notes'}, {pipelineType: 'tqs'}]`. Choices persist to `bible-editor.pipeline.generate.options` in localStorage. The 409-conflict dialog renders the existing-job metadata enriched into the response by the Worker. |
| [`web/src/components/PipelineStatusBar.tsx`](../web/src/components/PipelineStatusBar.tsx) | Bottom-area pill (sits left of `SyncStatusBar`). Shows running count, expands to a per-job panel with a horizontal stepper keyed off `current.skill` (Draft → Align → Push for generate; shorter ladders for notes/tqs). For `done` jobs the panel displays "AI output applied to ZEC N." Retry button surfaces for resumable failure kinds. Each row now also shows "Step 1 of 2 · follow-up …xyz" (parents) or "Step 2 of 2 · after …xyz" (children) when a parent-child link exists. Subscribes to `pipelineStore.onFocusRequest`; when a focus event fires, opens the popover anchored to the chip ref (Phase 3.4). |
| [`web/src/components/NoteCard.tsx`](../web/src/components/NoteCard.tsx) | When the chapter is locked (`locked` prop = `Boolean(chapterLock)`) AND `row.updated_by IS NULL`, the card is read-only and shows a Keep checkbox in its header (clicking fires `api.keepNote(id)`). When locked but `updated_by IS NOT NULL`, a Kept chip shows and the card stays editable. When `row.latest_source === 'ai_pipeline'`, the header carries an "AI" chip with a sparkle — it clears on the next human edit because subsequent edit_log rows drop `source` back to NULL. When not locked, behaves as before. Sparkles disabled while read-only. |
| [`web/src/components/ResourceColumn.tsx`](../web/src/components/ResourceColumn.tsx) | Accepts `locked` + `onKeepNote`. Hides the "new" button on each section head when locked. Threads `locked` to QuestionsTable and WordsTable; threads `locked` + `onKeepNote` to each NoteCard. |
| [`web/src/components/ScriptureColumn.tsx`](../web/src/components/ScriptureColumn.tsx) | Accepts `locked`. ORs it into `readOnly` for ULT/UST verses (UHB/UGNT were already read-only). Threads `locked` to StackedBody and BookView. |
| [`web/src/components/QuestionsTable.tsx`](../web/src/components/QuestionsTable.tsx) | Accepts `locked`. Inputs go `readOnly`; delete buttons hide. Each row renders a small sparkle icon next to the Ref input when `latest_source === 'ai_pipeline'`. |
| [`web/src/components/WordsTable.tsx`](../web/src/components/WordsTable.tsx) | Accepts `locked`. Disables interaction via `pointerEvents: none` + reduced opacity (simpler than threading through every drag handler; TWLs aren't AI-touched so this is purely a UX-consistency carve-out). |
| [`web/src/components/BookView.tsx`](../web/src/components/BookView.tsx) | Accepts `locked`. ORs into the per-cell `readOnly` derivation so editable bibles match the chapter view in book mode. |
| [`web/src/components/Shell.tsx`](../web/src/components/Shell.tsx) | Derives `chapterLock` from `pipelineStore` jobs. Mounts an `Alert` banner above the pipeline-menu row when locked. Subscribes to `onOutboxResult` and toasts when a write is dropped as `chapter_locked`. Threads `locked` to both columns + `handleKeepNote` to ResourceColumn. |

### How to test

```powershell
npm --workspace api run db:migrate:local      # apply pipeline_jobs migration
npm run dev                                   # vite :5173 + wrangler :8787
# Navigate to http://localhost:5173/#/ZEC/3
# Click "AI pipelines" -> "Write translation questions" -> Start
# Watch the bottom-right pill; expand it for details.
```

Local dev auto-signs in as `"dev"` via `/api/auth/dev` (gated by `DEV_AUTH_ENABLED=true` in `wrangler.toml`). No DCS OAuth round-trip needed for testing. `BT_API_TOKEN` and `JWT_SIGNING_KEY` are in `api/.dev.vars`.

Local D1 currently has only `ZEC` imported. Do not trigger pipelines on PSA — the user has explicitly carved PSA out of the editor's scope while other work happens there.

## Phase 2 — Inbound import + review flow

Bp-assistant returns an `output[]` array on `state: "done"` (see contract §4 and §6). Each element has a `rawUrl` pointing at a file on Door43. The editor needs to fetch, parse, and surface those changes for the translator to review.

### 2a. Parser only — DONE

Output shapes per contract §6 (re-iterated for reference):
- `pipelineType: "generate"` → two `output[]` entries: USFM files at `{nn}-{BOOK}.usfm` in `unfoldingWord/en_ult` and `unfoldingWord/en_ust`. Whole-book USFM; extract only the chapter range the job ran for.
- `pipelineType: "notes"` → one entry: TSV at `tn_{BOOK}.tsv` in `unfoldingWord/en_tn`. Whole-book TSV; filter to `pipeline_jobs.start_chapter…end_chapter`.
- `pipelineType: "tqs"` → one entry: TSV at `tq_{BOOK}.tsv` in `unfoldingWord/en_tq`. Same caveat.

Shipped as described in the file table above. Key points a Phase 2b agent needs to know:
- Staging schema chosen was **Option A** (`pending_imports` JSON-blob table). The original three options (A/B/C) are no longer in play — that decision is closed.
- The `payload_json` in each `pending_imports` row mirrors the body shape the existing `POST /api/rows/:kind` accepts (book, chapter, verse, ref_raw, tags, support_reference/quote/note/question/response, occurrence). For `kind='verse'` it's `{book, chapter, verse, bible_version, content_json, plain_text}` — Phase 2d will need to slightly massage this for the verses PATCH path. We deliberately do NOT diff against live rows at import time — every row in range is staged. The review UI in 2b/2c is where the diff happens.
- The pipeline-typed parsers handle the well-known repos (`en_ult`/`en_ust`/`en_tn`/`en_tq`). Anything else lands in `result.skipped` (logged, not stored). Worker logs are the only surface for now; no UI.
- Verse-object alignment (`\zaln-s` milestones, `\w` tokens) is preserved verbatim in `content_json` — `extractVersesForRange` doesn't strip anything. `web/src/lib/alignment.ts` is the existing read/write surface and is the natural starting point for the verse-review UI in 2c.

### 2b / 2c / 2d — all DONE under a revised model

The original 2b–2d plan called for a review dialog with per-row diff + accept/reject + an explicit accept-action step. The user revised the model in flight: AI output is now better than what it replaces, so the default action is **overwrite**, not review. The lock + auto-apply design above replaces the entire 2b–2d arc.

Highlights of the revised design:
- **No review dialog.** Translators don't see "accept this proposal" prompts. The auto-apply step runs on the first done-poll and overwrites verses, upserts TQs by stable id, deletes un-kept TNs, and inserts the AI's new TN set.
- **TN keep checkbox** is the only translator-facing choice. It lives on each TN card during a pipeline run; checking it fires `POST /api/rows/tn/:id/keep` which sets `updated_by` so the auto-apply step skips that row when sweeping un-kept TNs.
- **Server-enforced lock** prevents concurrent edits from racing the apply step. Already-queued offline edits that arrive during a lock are 409'd and discarded (the apply will overwrite anyway).
- **Audit trail** is preserved via `edit_log.source='ai_pipeline'`. A future UI feature can paint a chip on AI-authored rows; the data is in place.

What this trades off vs. the original review plan:
- We lose per-row "show me the diff before it lands." If a translator hated a specific AI suggestion, they'd have to edit it back manually after the apply.
- The dialog infrastructure built in 2b (`PendingImportsDialog`, `pendingImportsStore`, per-section Review buttons) was deleted.
- The `pending_imports` table still exists and is populated — it's now the apply input + audit ledger, not a queue for human review.

## Phase 3+ — follow-ups (each its own plan)

In rough priority order:

1. **Cancellation.** Contract §11 says it's not in v1. If the user wants it later, it's a coordinated change with bp-assistant — they'd need a `DELETE /api/pipeline/:jobId` and a corresponding handler.
2. **Concurrency UX v2 — live polling of other-user jobs.** Today the 409-conflict dialog is a one-shot snapshot of the existing job's state. A "watch this run" affordance that polls and refreshes would need a public-peek endpoint (current GET /:jobId 403s on cross-user reads). The data is in D1 already; just needs a route that returns the same shape as the 409 enrichment.
3. **Chapter macro v2 — display chain depth on children.** Phase 3.5's "Step 2 of 2" label is correct for asymmetric alignment (2 steps total) but understates the macro's 3-step chain. The data is on the row (a non-NULL `follow_up_chain` means more steps queued); the label just needs to count them.
4. **Phase 3.1 minimum-viable rollout — already-running self-detection.** If translator A's tab is closed and they reopen, their own 409 conflict on a re-POST should silently open the status panel instead of showing the cross-user dialog. Today the dialog renders regardless of who owns the conflicting job.

## Open architectural decisions

All four original decisions are closed under the revised lock + auto-apply model, and the worker-vs-browser polling question is now closed too:

1. ~~**Staging schema choice.**~~ **Closed: Option A** (`pending_imports` JSON-blob table). Shipped in migration 0009.
2. ~~**Conflict resolution policy.**~~ **Closed: no conflict resolution.** Verses and TQs overwrite unconditionally; TNs are wiped except for the ones the translator explicitly Keeps. The chapter lock prevents concurrent edits from creating conflicts in the first place.
3. ~~**Worker polling vs browser polling.**~~ **Closed: both.** Browser polls at 2 min while a tab is visible; the Worker cron polls every 5 min independently. Same `pollPipelineJob` code path, so the two never drift.
4. ~~**Proposal lifetime.**~~ **Closed: soft-resolved.** Each `pending_imports` row gets `accepted_at` stamped by the apply step. `rejected_at` is never set today (no review path) but the column stays for future audit/undo features.

## Reference material

- **Contract with bp-assistant:** [`docs/ai-pipeline-integration.md`](./ai-pipeline-integration.md). Authoritative on request/response shapes, error codes, output URLs, provenance markers. Read sections 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 carefully before Phase 2.
- **Approved Phase 1 plan:** `C:\Users\benja\.claude\plans\write-up-a-data-cheerful-penguin.md`. Captures the scoping decisions that led to "trigger + poll + status only" for the first PR.
- **Partner repos:**
  - [github.com/unfoldingWord/bp-assistant](https://github.com/unfoldingWord/bp-assistant) — the bot itself. `src/api/pipeline.ts` (the new endpoint pair) and `src/door43-push.js` (the `repo-insert` flow) are the relevant entry points if you need to verify behavior.
  - [github.com/unfoldingWord/bp-assistant-skills](https://github.com/unfoldingWord/bp-assistant-skills) — the Claude Code skill markdowns. Useful for understanding what a `generate` run actually produces.
- **Project-level handoff:** [`docs/handoff.md`](./handoff.md) — the broader bible-editor "where things live" doc.
- **Architecture decisions:** [`docs/plan.md`](./plan.md) — canonical project plan; AI integration is an addition, not a replacement.

## What to do first

### Always (any session)

1. Read this file and `ai-pipeline-integration.md`.
2. Sanity-check the build:
   - `cd api && npx tsc --noEmit`
   - `cd web && npx tsc -b --noEmit`
   - `cd api && node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings src/importParsers.test.mjs` (parser smoke against `docs/samples/`)
   - `cd api && npm run db:migrate:local` (idempotent — applies any unapplied migration)

   All four should pass cleanly on a freshly-pulled main. If one fails, that's the first thing to fix — don't layer new work on a broken baseline.

### With a translator in the room

3. Verify lock + auto-apply end-to-end against an **untouched** chapter (ZEC 6–12 — ZEC 3 has prior editor work and a partial tqs run that'd give noisy diffs):
   - Navigate `#/ZEC/7`, click "AI pipelines → Write translation questions" → Start.
   - The chapter banner should appear within ~2s ("AI tqs run in progress…").
   - Try to edit a TQ in the UI — input is read-only. Try via curl — receives 409 chapter_locked.
   - Click Keep on a TN — card flips to editable, Kept chip shows.
   - When the run completes (~30–60 min): `wrangler d1 execute bible_editor --local --command "SELECT count(*), source FROM edit_log WHERE row_key LIKE 'ZEC/7%' GROUP BY source"` should show a chunk of `source='ai_pipeline'` rows. The same TN cards now carry a small "AI" chip.
4. Asymmetric alignment dry-run: pick a generate, tick ULT + ULT-alignment + UST (no UST-alignment), Start. The dialog warns "runs as two pipelines back-to-back." Confirm by watching `pipeline_jobs` — parent shows up first, then on its `done` transition a second row appears with `session_key = '${parent}/followup'`. (~2× run time.)

### Autonomous (no translator available)

Skip steps 3–4. Live runs cost real bot time and translator attention; don't trigger them unsupervised.

Safe-to-pick-up items, in priority order:

- **Concurrency UX v2.** Add `GET /api/pipelines/:jobId/public` that returns the same shape as the 409 enrichment (`PipelineConflictExisting`). Wire the conflict dialog to poll it every ~2 min so translator B sees the run progress without re-clicking. Pair it with a "Watch this run" CTA in the dialog that hands the user off to the status panel.
- **Chapter macro chain-aware label.** PipelineStatusBar's "Step X of Y" line still says "of 2" even on macro children that have remaining chain. Read `follow_up_chain` from the row (currently fetched but unused on the client) and compute the actual depth.
- **Already-running self-conflict carve-out.** When the 409 conflict's `existing.started_by_username` matches the current user, skip the dialog and use the existing `requestFocus` flow (open the panel). Tiny PR.

What NOT to pick up without the user:

- **Anything that requires a real pipeline run to verify** — including changes to `pollPipelineJob`, `pipelineImport.ts`, or the chapter-lock semantics. Type-check + reasoning is fine for review prep; merging without an end-to-end run is not.
- **Cancellation (Phase 3.2)** — needs a coordinated contract change with bp-assistant.
- **Anything in PSA.** The user has carved Psalms out of the editor's scope while other work happens there.

Do NOT propose changes to bp-assistant from inside this repo. That's a separate session in a separate clone with its own Claude. If you discover the contract needs revision, write up the proposed change as text and leave it in `docs/` for the user to relay.

### After shipping

For each PR you land:
1. `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."` with a real test plan.
2. If you have permission and the change is mergeable, `gh pr merge --merge` and `git pull --ff-only origin main` in the main worktree so local stays current.
3. Update this file's status section in the same PR so the next session reads the right state.
