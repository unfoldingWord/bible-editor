// Tests for web/src/sync/outboxTargeting.ts — the FIFO-ordering rules that
// fix issue #487 ("Outbox FIFO inversion: a max-attempts-failed op can be
// auto-revived and silently overwrite a newer landed edit on the same
// target").
//
// The defect: a `failed` op did not block its target, so a younger sibling
// op for the same row/verse could leapfrog it and land first.
// threadVersionToSiblings then handed the stale failed op the fresh
// confirmed version, so when reviveMaxAttemptsFailed re-armed it (on focus /
// online / auth-refresh) the OLDER patch landed with a clean If-Match — no
// 409, no autoheal check — silently reverting the newer content. Both ops
// reported "ok"; nothing surfaced to the user.
//
// This module can't be exercised end-to-end without a browser (IndexedDB,
// window focus/online events), so these tests construct the exact op
// snapshots drainPass and threadVersionToSiblings would see at each step of
// the failure scenario from the issue, and assert the two predicates that
// fix it: isMaxAttemptsBlocked (drainPass's `blocked` set) and
// eligibleForVersionThread (threadVersionToSiblings's sibling filter).

// touches queuedAt — the op keeps its original queue position, so once it
// flips back to "pending" plain FIFO order alone keeps it ahead of op2.
//
// The user-driven Retry button is a separate code path (outbox.ts's
// retry()) that also flips a failed op to "pending" — the same loss of
// isMaxAttemptsBlocked's protection — but it used to ALSO refresh queuedAt
// to "now". That refresh is what reopens the hole: op2 queued at 2000,
// behind the then-failed op1; if op1's queuedAt jumps to "now" (e.g. 9000),
// op2's untouched 2000 makes it look OLDER, so plain FIFO hands op2 the
// target first. op2 lands, and being `eligibleForVersionThread` (pending),
// its fresh version threads straight into the just-retried op1 — which then
// drains and lands cleanly on top of op2's newer content. Same defect as
// #487, reached via Retry instead of auto-revival.
//
// outbox.ts's retry() now leaves queuedAt/seq untouched for exactly this
// class of op (isMaxAttemptsBlocked at the moment Retry is clicked), so it
// keeps its original, earlier queue position. Model both the buggy
// (queuedAt refreshed) and fixed (queuedAt preserved) shapes here to prove

// --- drainPass's `blocked` set must recompute per iteration, not just grow
// --- (issue #515) ---
//
// The bug: drainPass's `while (true)` loop built one `blocked` Set before
// the loop and only ever added to it. If retry() or reviveMaxAttemptsFailed()
// flips a blocking op back to "pending" *while a pass is running*, their own
// drain() call is a no-op (a pass is already active — see drain()'s
// `draining` guard), so the running pass is the only thing that will ever
// notice the revival. But since a target, once added to `blocked`, was never
// removed, the pass kept skipping the now-pending op for the rest of its
// iterations — even though a fresh snapshot no longer justifies blocking it —
// and exited without ever draining it. Nothing else re-triggers a pass, so
// the op sat stranded until an unrelated event (focus/online/next enqueue).
//
// The fix: recompute the status-derived portion of `blocked` fresh from each
// iteration's snapshot (seeded from a separate `pinnedBlocked` set that only
// holds targets *this pass* just parked as conflict/retry-backoff, which
// legitimately must stay blocked regardless of a later snapshot). These two
