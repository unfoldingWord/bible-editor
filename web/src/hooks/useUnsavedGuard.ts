// Warn before a full-page unload (reload — including the "App update available"
// chip's programmatic reload — tab close, or external navigation) when unsaved
// work would be lost. In-app navigation is already gated (runWithDirtyGate /
// requestDualAction in Shell); this covers the paths that tear the page down
// without ever routing through React.
//
// This is the safety net that was missing when a version-bump reload silently
// dropped a chapter of alignment work: alignment drags live only in React state
// until an explicit save, so a reload mid-alignment loses them with no trace.
// Text / note / row drafts persist in IndexedDB and survive the reload, but a
// translator who reloads past them still has to notice and re-save, so we warn
// for those too.
//
// beforeunload cannot run async work (no flushing IndexedDB from here) — the
// spec only lets us ask the browser to show its generic "Leave site? Changes
// you made may not be saved" confirm. That prompt is the guard; the user
// cancels, saves through the normal UI, then reloads.
//
// Two draft signals, both needed: the async `hasDrafts` subscription catches
// drafts persisted in a PRIOR session (present in IndexedDB before any set()
// this session), while the synchronous hasUnsavedDrafts() catches a draft the
// current session just wrote but whose subscription round-trip hasn't landed —
// the exact commit-window a quick reload would otherwise slip through.
